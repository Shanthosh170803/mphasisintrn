hi

i want nearly 100 data(records) in each file and the different related to each other just generate .txt file
while giving the inputs to you i will mention the length for each fileds and the data must be within the length mention in the brackets first filename : Customer.txt fields in it are customerId(5), customerName(20), customer Date of birth(dd/mm/yyyy), customerMobileNumber(10), customerEmailId(20), customerAddress(30) second filename: TransactionHistory.txt fields in it are TransactionId(5), timestamp(hh:mm:ss-dd/mm/yyyy), transactionAmount(upto Rs.1,00,000), Transaction type(UPI, net banking,card), sender name(20), sender Account number(11), sender bank name(10) , receiver name(20), receiver account number(11) , receiver bank name(10) , transaction status( success or failed) third filename: bank.txt fields in it are customerId(5), customerName(20),Bank name(10), Bank branch(10), customerAccountNumber(11), Account type(savings or current), Account balance(upto Rs.10,00,000) fourth filename: ATM Transaction .txt fields in it are customerId(5), customerName(20),Bank name(10), ATM id(10), card number(12), withdrawal amount( upto Rs.1,00,000), ATM Location(20), Transaction time(hh:mm:ss-dd/mm/yyyy) fifth filename: KYC Documents.txt fields in it are customerId(5), customerName(20),Bank name(10), KYC Status(Done or Not Done) before generating these file if you need any clarification , ask me fields in it are customer
Should the customerId in Customer.txt be consistently mapped across all other files? Yes Do TransactionHistory.txt and ATM Transaction.txt reference customers from Customer.txt, or should I generate independent transaction records? The first one , transactionhistory and atm transaction reference customers from customer.txt Should each customerId in bank.txt correspond to an entry in Customer.txt? Yes For KYC Documents.txt, should every customer from Customer.txt have a KYC status? Yes Should each field be separated by tabs, commas, or another delimiter in the .txt file? it should be generate by containing whitespace like in COBOL copybook Do you need padded spaces for fixed-length fields? (For example, should customerName(20) always have exactly 20 characters, padded if shorter?) Some customer name length varies to one other , so i need the customer name only below or equal to the lenght of 20 Should timestamp values be randomized within a particular range? the timestamp must be in the period from 01-01-2025 to 31-05-2025 Should customerEmailId follow realistic email patterns? yes, eample: customername123@gmail.com For account balances and transaction amounts, do you want completely random values or specific distributions (e.g., most transactions between Rs.500 and Rs.50,000)? yes
